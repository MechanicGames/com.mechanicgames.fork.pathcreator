# PathCreator

## Installation
Add the following path to dependencies in your manifest to install through [UPM](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.package-manager-ui@1.8/manual/index.html)  
```json
"dependencies": {
    "com.mechanicgames.fork.pathcreator": "1.2.0", // this is an example  
}
```

## Repo setup 
To easily stay in sync with the original repo,  
The package.json file is in a sub directory (/Assets/PathCreator/Core).
It includes only the essential files, and does not install the examples and documentation.pdf  

## Requirements
You need a unity version that supports sub directories in the github repo path  
Tested on Unity 6000.0.23f1.
